# AeroSensorTester: Automated Hardware Test Simulator with IA Anomaly Detection

Inspired by aerospace component testing (e.g., SpaceX rocket sensors), this project simulates hardware data, automates verification, and detects anomalies using TensorFlow. Built with C for embedded sim and Python for analysis—transferable from my agro drone work to space tech.

## Features
- Modular C/Python integration for hardware-software troubleshooting.
- Real-time anomaly detection on simulated sensor data (vibration/temp with noise/spikes).
- Interactive Dash dashboard for live viz—deployable online.
- Aligned to job reqs: Python automation, signal processing, data analysis.

## Setup
1. `make` to build C lib.
2. Run `python main.py` for CLI tests; `python dashboard.py` for web demo.

## Why This? 
Showcases my ability to jump into new tech for complex problems—like optimizing drone sensors for agro, now adapted for aero.
